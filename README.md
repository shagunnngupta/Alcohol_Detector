# üöó Alcohol Detection System using Arduino
Alcohol detector using ARDUINO UNO R3 and MQ-3 sensor on tinkercad

## üìù Problem Statement

Drunk driving is a major cause of road accidents, resulting in significant loss of life and property. Despite traffic regulations, it is often challenging to prevent intoxicated individuals from operating vehicles. Manual methods for checking alcohol consumption are time-consuming and not always feasible in real-time.

There is a need for a simple, low-cost, and effective system that can detect alcohol consumption by drivers and alert the system immediately to prevent potential hazards. This project aims to develop a **microcontroller-based alcohol detection system** that senses the presence of alcohol through breath analysis and triggers a warning mechanism‚Äîhelping in the prevention of drunk driving incidents.

## üéØ Scope of the Solution

This project proposes a **cost-effective and efficient alcohol detection system** using an Arduino Uno and an **MQ-3 alcohol sensor**. The system detects alcohol in a driver's breath and gives **real-time feedback via a buzzer alert**.

For simulation purposes on the **Tinkercad** platform, a generic gas sensor has been used in place of the MQ-3 sensor due to component availability limitations. However, the connections and logic are identical to what would be used with an actual MQ-3 sensor in physical implementation.

### üîß Potential Extensions
- Integration with **vehicle ignition systems** to block vehicle start if alcohol is detected  
- **GSM module** for sending alert messages  
- **IoT connectivity** for remote monitoring  
- **Data logging** for repeated violations
